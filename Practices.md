# Built-in Quality Practices

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) 

TDD is based on three rules, knows as 'The Three Laws of TDD': 

* You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
* You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
* You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently 
  failing test pass.
  
In code, TDD is translated into the cycle Red/Green/Refactor!

The rules of this cycle are as follows: 
* Create a unit tests that fails
* Write production code that makes that test pass. 
* Clean up the mess you just made.

The top 3 advantages of TDD are: 
* Requires in-depth understanding of the what the code should do
* Increases the confidence in changing parts of the code
* Reduces the debugging time
