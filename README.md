[Queuing theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory) is the real explanation of why investing in quality up-front will make your team faster. The problem is that it is not the funniest topic to study. After trying the standard training approach at [Murex](www.murex.com), we decided to go for something else, and created this table-top (serious) game.

## How does it go?

The game is a collaborative game that lasts for about 1h15. The whole team can play. While the game's goal is to maximize output, the training goal is to let people experience the change in flow as they invest in new skills.

## How to use this game?

Playing the game is a 4 steps process:

1. Read the [rules](Rules.md)
2. Read the [animator's guide](AnimationGuide.md)
3. Print and cut-out the [material](https://github.com/philou/built-in-quality-game/tree/master/material)
4. Play the game
